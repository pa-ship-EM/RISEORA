# RiseOra AI Video Repurposing: The Exact System

This is the end-to-end factory for turning one 5-minute recording into a month of content (36–48 videos).

## 📥 Input
- 1 Video (≈5 minutes)
- Format: MP4
- Requirement: Clear voice/audio

## 🔄 The 5-Step Process

### Step 1: Transcribe (The Fuel)
AI needs text to "understand" the video. Use **Descript**, **Whisper AI**, or **CapCut Auto Captions** to generate a full transcript.

### Step 2: AI Selection (The Strategy)
Paste the transcript into ChatGPT/AI using the **RiseOra Selection Prompt** (found in [AI Prompts](file:///Users/amos/Desktop/11/docs/brand/marketing/templates/ai_prompts.md)) to identify 10–15 high-impact moments without scrubbing the timeline.

### Step 3: Vertical Cutting (The Frame)
Using the timestamps/sentences from Step 2, cut the raw video into 10–15 vertical (9:16) clips (20–45 seconds each).

### Step 4: Multiplier (The Magic)
Turn each raw clip into 4 distinct versions:
- **Version A (The Baseline)**: Original clip + Auto captions.
- **Version B (The Cinematic Remix)**: Same words, new AI-generated visuals (Runway/Pika).
- **Version C (The Aesthetic Text)**: Minimalist background + Elegant typography.
- **Version D (The Voice Monologue)**: AI Voice (ElevenLabs) + Stock/Abstract visuals.

### Step 5: Master Branding (The Factory)
Create **ONE** master template in CapCut/VEED. Every new clip is just a "drop-in" to maintain 100% RiseOra consistency.
