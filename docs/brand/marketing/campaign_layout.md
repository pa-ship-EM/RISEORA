# RiseOra Marketing Campaign Layout

A structured multi-channel campaign to drive growth and build the "Rise" community.

## 1. The "Ascent" Lead Magnet (The Entry Point)
**Goal**: Build an email list of high-value seekers.
- **Asset**: "The Riseora Morning Protocol" (A high-aesthetic 5-page PDF).
- **Core Value**: 3 micro-disciplines to rewire the mind before 8 AM.
- **CTA**: "Download the Protocol and Begin Your Ascent."

## 2. The Email Funnel (The Education)
**Subject Line Style**: Minimal, intriguing, short.

| Step | Day | Topic | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 0 | The Welcome | Delivery of PDF + Brand Story. |
| 2 | 2 | The Friction | Why most "hustle culture" fails. |
| 3 | 4 | The Identity | The concept of 'Acting As If'. |
| 4 | 7 | The Invitation | Introduction to the core product/community. |

## 3. Paid Social Strategy (Instagram / TikTok)
**Creative Vibe**: Slow-motion b-roll, soft lighting, bronze accents.

- **Ad 1 (Aesthetic)**: POV shot of a clean morning routine with the text: "Clarity is the ultimate luxury."
- **Ad 2 (Value)**: A quick edit of the 5 Habits Carousel with a voiceover explaining "Identity Shifting."
- **Retargeting**: "You don't need permission to reinvent yourself. Start today."

## 4. Collaborative Marketing (Influencers)
**Niche**: Minimalist architects, wellness entrepreneurs, productivity creators.
- **Strategy**: Send "RiseOra" branded aesthetic planners or digital templates for "Behind the scenes" daily stories.

## 5. Community Recommendations
