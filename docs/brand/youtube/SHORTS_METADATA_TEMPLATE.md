## 📊 Shorts-Specific Optimization

### Title Best Practices
- ✅ Under 60 characters (displays fully on mobile)
- ✅ Start with power words: "Why", "How", "The", "Stop", "Start"
- ✅ Create curiosity or promise value
- ✅ Use numbers when applicable
- ❌ Don't use clickbait that doesn't deliver
- ❌ Avoid all caps (except for emphasis on 1-2 words)

### Title Formulas

**Pattern Interrupt**:
- "Stop [doing X]. Do [Y] instead."
- "Everyone gets [X] wrong. Here's why."

**Value Promise**:
- "The [framework/method] that changed my [area]"
- "How to [achieve result] in [timeframe]"

**Curiosity Gap**:
- "Why [surprising fact]"
- "The truth about [topic]"

**Direct Statement**:
- "[Bold claim about topic]"
- "[Counterintuitive insight]"

## 🎨 Thumbnail Considerations for Shorts

While YouTube auto-generates shorts thumbnails from frames, you can optimize:

**Visual Moments to Include**:
- Text overlays with key phrases (large, readable font)
- Your face showing emotion (if applicable)
- Clean, high-contrast visuals
- Brand colors (bronze/sage) in frame

**Text Overlay Guidelines**:
- Maximum 3-5 words per frame
- Use bold, sans-serif fonts
- High contrast (white on dark, or vice versa)
- Position in upper 2/3 of frame (safe zone)

---

## 📈 Posting Strategy for Shorts

### Timing
- **Best Times**: 
  - Morning: 6-9 AM EST (catch early scrollers)
  - Lunch: 12-2 PM EST (midday break)
  - Evening: 6-9 PM EST (after work/school)
- **Best Days**: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- **Frequency**: 3-5 shorts per week (consistency > volume)

### Cross-Promotion
1. **Instagram Reels**: Post same short 2-4 hours after YouTube
2. **TikTok**: Post 24 hours after YouTube (test different times)
3. **Twitter/X**: Post teaser clip with link to full short
4. **Stories**: Share to Instagram/Facebook stories

### Sequencing Strategy
- **Day 1**: Post long-form video
- **Day 2-3**: Post "Hook Short" to drive traffic to long-form
- **Day 4-5**: Post "Value Bomb Short" for standalone value
- **Day 6-7**: Post "Story/CTA Short" to build community
