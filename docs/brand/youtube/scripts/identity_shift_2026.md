## 🎬 Section 1: The Hook (0:00 - 0:45)
**Visual**: Slow-motion b-roll of a clean morning routine. Sunrise through minimalist windows. Text overlay: "IDENTITY > EFFORT".

**Narration**: 
Most people think that to change their life, they need to *do* more. More coffee, more hours, more hustle. But they’re building a mansion on a broken foundation. 

If you’ve ever felt like your past self is holding you hostage, this is for you. In 2026, we’re not doing resolutions. We’re doing an identity revolution. 

Today, I’m breaking down the RiseOra Method for rapid identity shifting. Because you can’t build a higher-level life with a lower-level mindset.

## 🏛️ Section 2: The Framework (0:45 - 2:00)
**Visual**: Clean, elegant graphic showing the R.I.S.E Method.

**Narration**:
To rise upward, you must first rise inward. This is the Architecture of Becoming. 

The secret isn’t willpower. It’s **Relentless Intentionality**. 

Think of your identity as the software of your life. If you want a different output, you have to rewrite the code. Every decision you make is a vote for the person you want to become.

## 📖 Section 3: The "Wait" Story (2:00 - 3:30)
**Visual**: Close-up of a minimalist desk setup. Soft bronze accents.

**Narration**:
I used to wait. Wait for permission, wait for the right time, wait for the feeling of "readiness." But readiness is a myth. 

The moment everything changed for me was when I realized that I didn't need to *find* myself. I needed to *create* myself. I started acting "as if." Not faking it, but embodying the discipline of my future self today.

## 🚀 Section 4: The Closing & CTA (3:30 - 5:00)
**Visual**: Sunrise over a modern skyline. Abstract "elevation" imagery.

**Narration**:
Your highest identity is waiting. It’s not in the future; it’s in your next decision. 

If you're ready to begin your ascent, I’ve put together the **RiseOra Morning Protocol**—a micro-discipline framework to rewire your mind before 8 AM. Link is in the description.
