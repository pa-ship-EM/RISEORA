00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hey everyone. We've all seen the 'AI is changing the world' videos.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But most of it feels like noise.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today, I want to pull back the curtain and show you exactly how I built a high-end brand—

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
RiseOra—from nothing but an idea to a full strategy, visual identity, and content engine.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And I did it using AI. Not to cut corners, but to amplify the vision.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If you’ve been sitting on an idea because you didn’t think you had the 'skills,' this video is for you.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I’m your big brother in this process. Let’s get into it.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It starts with the soul.

9
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I used AI to help me articulate what was in my head.

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I fed it my mission: To empower individuals to rise into their highest identity.

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But the AI helped me refine the pillars. We came up with the 'RISE' method.

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Key Takeaway: Don't just ask AI for 'a brand.' Tell it YOUR values first.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Then ask it to architect a system around them.

14
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Next: The look.

15
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I wanted 'Minimalist, High-end, Bronze and Sage.'

16
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I used image generators to iterate on logos.

17
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I didn't take the first thing it gave me. I poked it. I prodded it.

18
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I refined the prompts until it felt like RiseOra.

19
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Big Brother Moment: Precision beats volume. Take the time to get the aesthetic right.

20
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It’s the first thing people feel.

21
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The biggest hurdle is consistency. I used AI to draft the first 30 days of content.

22
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But here’s the secret: I edited every single word.

23
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
AI gives you the skeleton; you give it the heart.

24
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I’ll show you the scripts we generated for the flagship channel and how I’m using tools like HeyGen and Runway to animate them.

25
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
People ask me why I’m sharing the 'secret sauce.' It’s because the technology is just a tool.

26
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The vision is yours. RiseOra is about rising inward first.

27
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You can’t build a higher-level brand if you’re operating at a lower-level mindset.

28
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That’s why this channel exists. To bridge that gap.

29
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If this helped you, download the 'RiseOra Morning Protocol' I built—link is in the description.

30
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It’s the same discipline I used to get this project off the ground.

31
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Rise inward. Rise upward. I’ll see you in the next one.
