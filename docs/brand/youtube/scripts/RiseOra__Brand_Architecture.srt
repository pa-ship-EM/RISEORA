1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We live in a world of constant noise,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
where the pursuit of "success" is often equated with chaotic hustle and external validation.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
RiseOra was born from a different realization:

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that true transformation doesn't come from working harder at the wrong things,

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but from becoming the person who handles the right things with ease.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It started with a simple question:

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What happens when we apply the principles of high-end design—

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
clarity, minimalism, and intentionality—to the human mind?

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
RiseOra isn't just a mindset brand; it's a bridge.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We represent the space between where you are and your highest potential.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We believe that self-mastery is the ultimate form of creativity.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
By stripping away the clutter of old habits and mental limitations,

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
we reveal the masterpiece that was always there.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We call this The Ascent.

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Our Mission: To empower individuals to rise into their highest identity.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We provide the frameworks, the discipline, and the aesthetic inspiration

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
needed to rewire the mind and elevate daily life.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
RiseOra is the calm at the center of the storm.

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's the crisp morning air before the world wakes up.

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's the satisfaction of a disciplined day.

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's clean, it's quiet, it's powerful.

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You don't need permission to reinvent yourself.

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You only need the courage to rise.

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
RiseOra: Rise Inward. Rise Upward.
