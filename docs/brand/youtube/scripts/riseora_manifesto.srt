1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We are told that life happens to us.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That we are the sum of our circumstances, our pasts, and our limitations.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But this is the architecture of the lower self.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It is the noise that keeps you small.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It is the chaos that masks the clarity.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Choice is not a grand event.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It is not a stage, or a crowd, or a finish line.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Choice is a quiet moment in a dark room.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It is the first breath of a morning you didn't want to start.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It is the decision to stop negotiating with the version of you that is comfortable with mediocrity.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
To rise is to architect a new identity.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It is to strip away the clutter of old beliefs until only the core remains.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Clarity. Discipline. Elevation.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
These are not just words.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
They are the scaffolding of your highest self.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The moment you choose to rise... is the moment the world begins to rearrange itself to meet you.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Rise inward. Rise upward.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Your ascent begins now.
