PHASE 1: PRE-DISPUTE (INFORMATION GATHERING)
Step 1: Identify the Account

Confirm:

Creditor / Collector name

Account number (partial is acceptable)

Reporting bureau(s)

Account status (collection, charge-off, open/closed)

📌 Goal: Ensure the consumer is disputing the correct tradeline.

Step 2: Determine Eligibility for Debt Validation

Debt Validation applies only if:

The account is being collected by a third-party debt collector

The debt is not the original creditor

The consumer is within, or even outside, the 30-day window
(late DVs are still valid but treated differently)

📌 Authority: FDCPA §809
📌 Purpose: Force proof of the debt and collection authority

PHASE 2: DEBT VALIDATION (FDCPA)
Step 3: Send Debt Validation Request

Consumer sends a written DV request asking for:

Proof the debt exists

Proof the collector has authority to collect

Itemization of balance

Original creditor information

📌 Sent directly to the debt collector
📌 This is not a credit bureau dispute

Step 4: Wait for Collector Response

Collector may:

✔️ Provide validation

❌ Provide insufficient documentation

❌ Fail to respond

❌ Continue reporting without validation (violation)

⏱ No strict response deadline, but reporting without validation creates risk

PHASE 3: EVALUATE THE RESPONSE (CRITICAL DECISION POINT)
Step 5: Review Validation for Sufficiency

Ask:

Did they prove the debt is tied to the consumer?

Did they show authority to collect?

Is the balance explained?

Is documentation specific or generic?

📌 Validation ≠ Accuracy
📌 Even “validated” debts must still be FCRA + Metro 2 compliant

PHASE 4: FORMAL FCRA DISPUTE (CRA LEVEL)
Step 6: File FCRA §611 Dispute With Credit Bureaus

Consumer disputes the tradeline with:

Experian

Equifax

TransUnion

Dispute is based on:

Inaccurate reporting

Incomplete data

Metro 2 inconsistencies

Failure to properly investigate

📌 This triggers a legal investigation requirement

Step 7: CRA Forwards Dispute to Furnisher

Sent through e-OSCAR

Furnisher must conduct a reasonable investigation

Furnisher must verify accuracy under Metro 2 standards

⏱ 30-day investigation window

PHASE 5: FURNISHER OBLIGATIONS (FCRA §623)
Step 8: Furnisher Must:

Review all dispute information

Verify each reported field

Correct or delete inaccurate data

Respond to CRA within 30 days

📌 “Verified” without investigation = potential violation

PHASE 6: OUTCOME HANDLING
Step 9: CRA Response Received
Outcome A: Corrected / Deleted

Process ends

Account updated or removed

Outcome B: Verified as Accurate

Does not end the process

Triggers escalation rights

PHASE 7: ESCALATION RIGHTS
Step 10: Request Method of Verification (MOV)

Under FCRA §611(a)(7), consumer may ask:

How was the information verified?

Who verified it?

What records or systems were used?

📌 CRAs must respond with meaningful detail

Step 11: File Direct Dispute With Furnisher

If inaccuracies remain:

Consumer sends a Direct Dispute to the furnisher

Furnisher must re-investigate and respond

📌 Authority: FCRA §623(a)(8)

PHASE 8: REGULATORY & LEGAL PATH (IF NEEDED)
Step 12: Escalation Options

If violations persist:

CFPB complaint

State Attorney General

FTC (pattern behavior)

Consumer rights attorney (if damages exist)

📌 This is where enforcement, not “credit repair,” occurs
