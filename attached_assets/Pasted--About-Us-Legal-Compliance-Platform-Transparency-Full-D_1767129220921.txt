About RiseOra — Your Credit Education & Guided Support Platform

Section 1 — Who We Are

RiseOra is a credit education and guided support platform. We empower consumers to understand, manage, and assert their credit rights through structured workflows, tools, and resources.

Important: RiseOra does not submit disputes on your behalf. Clients remain in full control of sending all communications to credit bureaus.

Section 2 — Our Core Values

Education-First: Knowledge is power. Learn why items appear on your report and how to address them.

Guided Support: We provide step-by-step workflows, templates, and checklists.

Transparency: Every feature, workflow, and subscription plan is explained upfront.

Security: All personal data is encrypted at rest and in transit, with bank-level 256-bit security.

Section 3 — Legal Compliance

RiseOra follows federal and state regulations:

1️⃣ CROA — Credit Repair Organizations Act (15 U.S.C. § 1679)

We do not charge upfront fees for work not yet performed.

We provide a written agreement for all paid services.

We include a 3-day cancellation notice for all subscriptions.

We do not promise deletion of negative items or specific score increases.

2️⃣ FCRA — Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. § 1681)

We educate consumers on their rights under FCRA.

We help identify potential inaccuracies.

We provide guidance without filing disputes directly.

3️⃣ FTC & State Laws

Marketing language is factual and transparent.

We avoid any “guaranteed results” or “credit repair” claims.

State-specific regulations are considered in our workflow, especially in high-risk states (CA, NY, TX, FL, GA).
